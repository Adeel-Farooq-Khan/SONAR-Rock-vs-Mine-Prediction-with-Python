I'm excited to share my latest machine learning project: Rock vs. Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression!

In this project, I used logistic regression to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. I used the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 208 instances and 60 features.

First, I preprocessed the data by scaling and normalizing the features. Then, I split the data into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets.

Next, I trained a logistic regression model using the scikit-learn library. I used the default hyperparameters, which worked well for this dataset.

Once the model was trained, I evaluated its performance on the testing set. The model achieved an accuracy of 76.1% on the testing set, which is a good result.


This project showcases the power of logistic regression in solving classification problems. Logistic regression is a simple but effective algorithm that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.
